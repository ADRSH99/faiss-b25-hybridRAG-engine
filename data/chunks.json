    "text": "music theory is the study of theoretical frameworks for understanding the practices and possibilities of music. the oxford companion to music describes three interrelated uses of the term \" music theory \" : the first is the \" rudiments \", that are needed to understand music notation ( key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation ) ; the second is learning scholars ' views on music from antiquity to the present ; the third is a sub - topic of musicology that \" seeks to define processes and general principles in music \". the musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \" in that it takes as its starting - point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built. \" music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. because of the ever - expanding conception of what constitutes music, a more inclusive definition could be the considera tion of any sonic phenomena, including silence. this is not an absolute guideline, however ; for example, the study of \" music \" in the quadrivium liberal arts university curriculum, that was common in medieval europe, was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice. but this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory. music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts that composers and other musicians use in creating and performing music. the development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music - making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. for example, ancient instruments from prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have be en used by their makers. in ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music - making. many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research. in modern academia, music theory is a subfield of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. guido adler, however, in one of the texts that founded musicology in the late 19th century, wrote that \""

    "text": "a musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. in principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument — it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. a person who plays a musical instrument is known as an instrumentalist. the history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. early musical instruments may have been used for rituals, such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies. the exact date and specific origin of the first device considered a musical instrument, is widely disputed. the oldest object identified by scholars as a musical instrument, is a simple flute, dated back 50, 000 – 60, 000 years. many scholars date early flutes to about 40, 000 years ago. many historians believe that d etermining the specific date of musical instrument invention is impossible, as the majority of early musical instruments were constructed of animal skins, bone, wood, and other non - durable, bio - degradable materials. additionally, some have proposed that lithophones, or stones used to make musical sounds — like those found at sankarjang in india — are examples of prehistoric musical instruments. musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. however, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. by the post - classical era, instruments from mesopotamia were in maritime southeast asia, and europeans played instruments originating from north africa. development in the americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of north, central, and south america shared musical instruments. by 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the occident. during the clas sical and romantic periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. while the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, the proliferation of electricity led to the invention of new electric and electronic instruments, such as electric guitars, synthesizers, and the theremin. musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. instruments can be classified by their effective range, material composition, size, role, etc. however, the most common academic method, hornbostel – sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound. the academic study of musical instruments"

    "text": "indian classical music is the classical music of the indian subcontinent. it is generally described using terms like shastriya sangeet and marg sangeet. it has two major traditions : the north indian classical music known as hindustani and the south indian expression known as carnatic. hindustani music emphasizes improvisation and exploration of all aspects of a raga, while carnatic performances tend to be short composition - based. however, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences. another unique classical music tradition from the eastern part of india is odissi music, which has evolved over the last two thousand years. the roots of the classical music of india are found in the vedic literature of hinduism and the ancient natyashastra, the classic sanskrit text on performing arts by bharata muni. the 13th century sanskrit text sangeeta - ratnakara of sarangadeva is regarded as the definitive text by both the hindustani music and the carnatic music traditions. indian classical music has two foundational elements, raga and tala. the raga, based on a varied repertoire of swara ( notes including microtones ), forms the fabric of a deeply intricate melodic structure, while the tala measures the time cycle. the raga gives an artist a palette to build the melody from sounds, while the tala provides them with a creative framework for rhythmic improvisation using time. in indian classical music the space between the notes is often more important than the notes themselves, and it traditionally eschews western classical concepts such as harmony, counterpoint, chords, or modulation."

( the other genre being the hindustani classical music. ) the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gayaki ( singing ) style. although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of sruti ( the relative musical pitch ), svara ( the musical sound of a single note ), raga ( the mode or melodic formulae ), and tala ( the rhythmic cycles ) form the foundation of improvisation and compo sition in both carnatic and hindustani music. although improvisation plays an important role, carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti ( or kirtanam ) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as purandara dasa, and the trinity of carnatic music. carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions. telugu language predominates in the evolution of carnatic music. carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer ( usually a vocalist ), a melodic accompaniment ( usually a violin ), a rhythm accompaniment ( usually a mridangam ), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. the greatest concentration of carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of chennai. various carnatic music festivals are held throughout india and abroad, including the madras music season, which has been considered to be one of the world ' s largest cultural events."

    "text": "musical composition can refer to an original piece or work of music, either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. people who create new compositions are called composers. composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters ; with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. in many cultures, including western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \" score \", which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. in popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. in classical music, orchestration ( choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, basslin e and so on ) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. in some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. in jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. a work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs. a piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the s inger or musician should create musical sounds. examples range from 20th century avant - garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as karlheinz stockhausen ' s aus den sieben tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as john cage, morton feldman and witold lutosławski. a more commonly known example of chance - based, or indeterminate, music"

' counterpoint '. counterpoint has been most commonly identified in the european classical tradition, strongly developing during the renaissance and in much of the common practice period, especially in the baroque period. in western pedagogy, counterpoint is taught through a system of species ( see below ). there are several different forms of counterpoint, including imitative counterpoint and free counterpoint. imitative counterpoint involves the repetition of a main melodic idea across different vocal parts, with or without variation. compositions written in free counterpoint often incorporate non - traditional harmonies and chords, chromaticism and dissonance."

    "text": "orchestration is the study or practice of writing music for an orchestra ( or, more loosely, for any musical ensemble, such as a concert band ) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. also called \" instrumentation \", orchestration is the assignment of different instruments to play the different parts ( e. g., melody, bassline, etc. ) of a musical work. for example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra. in classical music, composers have historically orchestrated their own music. only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. in modern classical music, composers almost invariably orchestrate their own work. two notable exceptions to this are ravel ' s orchestration of mussorgsky ' s solo piano work pictures at an exhibition and malcolm arnold ' s orchestration of william walton ' s string quartet in a minor, producing the latter ' s sonata for strings. however, in musical theatre, film music and other commercial media, it is customary to use orchestrators and arrangers to one degree or another, since time constraints and / or the level of training of composers may preclude them orchestrating the music themselves. the precise role of the orchestrator in film music is highly variable, and depends greatly on the needs and skill set of the particular composer. in musical theatre, the composer typically writes a piano / vocal score and then hires an arranger or orchestrator to create the instrumental score for the pit orchestra to play. in jazz big bands, the composer or songwriter may write a lead sheet, which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers may \" flesh out \" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the rhythm section ( bass, piano / jazz guit ar / hammond organ, drums ). but, commonly enough, big band composers have done their own arranging, just like their classical counterparts."

    "text": "the continent of africa and its music is vast and highly diverse, with different regions and nations maintaining distinct musical traditions. african music includes genres such as makwaya, highlife, mbube, township music, juju, fuji, jaiva, afrobeat, afrofusion, mbalax, congolese rumba, soukous, ndombolo, makossa, kizomba, and taarab, among others. african music also uses a wide variety of instruments from across the continent. the music and dance traditions of the african diaspora, shaped to varying degrees by african musical traditions, include american genres such as dixieland jazz, blues, and jazz, as well as caribbean styles such as calypso ( see kaiso ), and soca. latin american music genres including cumbia, salsa, son cubano, rumba, conga, bomba, samba, and zouk developed from the music of enslaved africans and have, in turn, influenced contemporary african popular music. like the music of asia, india, and the middle east, african music is highly rhythmic. its complex rhythmic pa tterns often involve one rhythm played against another to create a polyrhythm. a common example is the three - against - two rhythm, comparable to a triplet played against straight notes. sub - saharan african music traditions frequently rely on a wide array of percussion instruments, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone - producing instruments such as the mbira or \" thumb piano \". another distinguishing feature of african music is its call - and - response style, in which one voice or instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase is echoed by another voice or instrument. this interaction also extends to the rhythm, with one drum playing a rhythmic pattern that is echoed or complemented by another. african music is also highly improvised. a core rhythmic pattern is typically played, with drummers then improvising new patterns over the established foundation. traditional music in much of the continent is passed down through oral tradition. subtle differences in pitch and intonati on that do not easily translate to western notation. african music most closely adheres to western tetratonic ( four - note ), pentatonic ( five - note ), hexatonic ( six - note ), and heptatonic ( seven - note ) scales. harmonization of the melody is accomplished by singing in parallel thirds, fourths, or fifth"
